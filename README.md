## Overview

**_Refractile_**: _"...capable of refraction"_

[- Merriram Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/refractile)

With this package, you gain the ability to refract server-side functionality when using Express through the many prisms of other languages. In other words, when you choose to use Express, which is fast, lightweight, and quick to spin up, you can still make use of the benefit of languages other than JavaScript.

While so much of web development has become monoglossic as JavaScript has come to dominate not just frontend but also backend development, with Refractile you can experience a best-of-all-worlds developer experience, gaining the speed of C or the affordances of some particular package for Go, all packaged in a server written with Express.

## Installation

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed before you begin.

You can install refractile into your package using the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```console
$ npm install refractile
```

## Core Concepts

The two core concepts to understand when working with this package are its configuration system and the function `refract` itself.

### The function

The interface for `refract` is simple: it takes two arguments â€” a reference to a module and a function on that module to be invoked. As an exmaple, this would look as follows:

```js
refract('some_module', 'some_function');
```

Simple!

`refract` returns an express middleware function, in other words a function that expects a Request object, a Response object, and a Next function. These are the arguments that will be fed into the function requested on the module, which, in the example above, would be `some-funciton`.

`refract` works with WebAssembly under the hood; currently, it requires JavaScript glue code to run. In the example above `some_module` would be associated with a file called `some_module.js` that is responsible for instantiating `some_module.wasm`. The point of this package is to organize the compilation of `.wasm` files and, in some cases, `.js` glue code as express middleware.

### The configuration

The function `refract` works with a configuration file called `refractile.config.js`. For `refract` to work, _you must also create and configure `refractile.config.js`_.

The configuration file looks as follows:

```js
module.exports = {
    preload_cmds: [ ] // This is an array of strings representing commands that will run when the configuration is loaded. Use it to create or copy any resources that your modules will depend on

    modules: { // This object contains the unique configurations for each module you want to include

        some_module: { // The name of the module is organized by this key

            bin: "./some_folder", // The folder where refractile will look for the JS module

            make: " ", // The command to be evaluated for building sources into WASM modules

            src: " ", // The path to the source code. Refract will use this reference to determine if the module needs to be rebuilt after the code updates.

            gluecode_src: " " // If your compiler does not generate WebAssembly gluecode, you can write your own. When you point to it with this option, it will be copied into the bin folder with a name matching the module key (e.g. some_module) and a .js extension after the .wasm file was compiled.
        }
    }
};
```
